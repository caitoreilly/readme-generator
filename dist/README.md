## Installation

First, ensure that you have Node.js installed on your local machine. Then in your terminal, use the command git clone and paste the link to this repository so that you can clone it to your local machine. Next, run the command “npm init -y” to install Node Package Manager. Finally, run the command “npm i inquirer” to install Inquirer and its associated dependencies. 

## Usage

In your terminal, run the command “node index.js”. Then go through and answer the questions by typing in your information. Press enter after each response to bring you to the next question. If you do not answer a required question, you will be prompted again to answer it. After you answer each question, your responses will be saved and the data will be used to generate a README.md file. You can find this file in the dist folder in VS Code. You will see all of your input in the corresponding sections of the README.md file. You can navigate the file through the Table of Contents.
